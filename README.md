# Unfollowed
A program that prints out Instagram users that you follow but don't follow you back. Makes it easy to clean up your feed ;).

Here's how to use it:
1. Login to your Instagram account and download your data as a JSON. Follow the instructions in this link: https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920
2. Download the folder in the email sent by Instagram.
3. Open the folder and select the "followers_and_following" folder. Locate the "followers.json" and "following.json" files.
4. Copy those files into a new folder.
5. Open the new folder in VSCode. Create and new file and copy the code in "unfollowers.py" in this repo into your file.
6. Run the file in the terminal (e.g. python3 unfollowers.py).
